# The Voxelmanip Minetest Wiki
This is the repository containing the pages that are available on [The Voxelmanip Minetest Wiki](https://wiki.voxelmanip.se/). It has been moved into a Git repository for simplicity and to ease maintenance.

Contributing to the Wiki is now done via GitHub. Simply fork, make an edit and open a pull request for it.

The Wiki pages use Markdown with some custom extensions made to it. See the [Contribution page](https://principia-web.se/wiki/Contributing#Markdown_extensions) on the Principia Wiki, which uses a similar Wiki software to what the Voxelmanip Wiki uses.
