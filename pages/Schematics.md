Schematics are files that describe a portion of Minetest nodes. Minetest schematics have nothing to do with the file format used by the Minecraft community that has the same name.

Minetest provides built-in functionality for mods to place structures, or schematics, with decorations or with the `minetest.place_schematic` function. The binary schematic format is stored in `.mts` files and can be generated by the engine with `minetest.create_schematic`.

## Editing
* [Schematic Editor (`schemedit`)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/schemedit/) is a mod that allows you to import, edit and export schematics straight within Minetest.

* [MTSEdit](https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/mtsedit) is an external program for Windows, macOS and Linux where you can edit schematics in an isometric view.
