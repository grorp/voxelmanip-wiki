[minetest_docs](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_docs) was a project that sought out to create better documentation for Minetest. The proposal for the project which included its goals can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/benrob0329/df3ced15dc5a2d5402010be709452f27).

For various reasons the project fell flat and is currently dormant but contains some gems, most of which is available on the Voxelmanip Wiki.
