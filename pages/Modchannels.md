## Server Side API

### Functions

#### `minetest.mod_channel_join(channel_name)`

* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name

Returns an object for use with [Methods](#Methods). Creates the channel if it does not exist and joins the channel.

#### `minetest.register_on_modchannel_message(function(channel_name, sender, message))`

* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name (already joined)
* `sender`: string, empty if from a SSM, player name if from a client
* `message`: string, message

Used for handling messages received from the client.

### Methods

NOTE: `channel` here means the object returned by `minetest.mod_channel_join`.

#### `channel:leave()`

The server will leave the channel, meaning no more messages from this channel on `minetest.register_on_modchannel_message`

TIP: Set the channel to `nil` afterwords to free resources

#### `channel:is_writeable()`

* Returns `bool`: `true` true if the channel is writeable, `false` if it's not.

#### `channel:send_all(message)`

* `message`: string, limited to 65535 bytes

Sends to all SSMs and CSMs on the channel.

CAUTION: The message will not if channel is not writable or invalid.

## Client Side API

### Functions

#### `minetest.mod_channel_join(channel_name)`

* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name

Returns an object for use with [Methods](#Methods). Creates the channel if it does not exist and joins the channel. Is equivalent to the the server side function.

#### `minetest.register_on_modchannel_message(function(channel_name, sender, message))`

* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name (already joined and recieved acknowledgement)
* `sender`: string, empty if from a SSM, player name if from a client
* `message`: string, message

Used for handling messages received from the client. Is equivalent to the the server side function.

#### `minetest.register_on_modchannel_signal(function(channel_name, signal))`
* `channel_name`: string, channel name that the signal has come in on
* `signal`: integer, 0 - 5

0. join_ok
1. join_failed
2. leave_ok
3. leave_failed
4. event_on_not_joined_channel
5. state_changed

Used to handle signals generated by the mod channel system.

### Methods

NOTE: `channel` here means the object returned by `minetest.mod_channel_join`.
